Computer vision is all about how we acquire, process, analyze, and truly understand images. 
The end result can be a description, an interpretation, or even some quantitative measurements that help us make sense of complex, 
high-dimensional data from the real world. Essentially, it’s about mimicking how humans see and interpret their surroundings.
This field intersects with various areas like understanding, robotics, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and pattern recognition.
The magic happens when computers electronically interpret and grasp images. 
As a scientific discipline, computer vision dives into the theories behind artificial systems that pull information from images. 
The data we work with can come in many forms, whether it’s video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or even multi- dimensional data from medical scanners. 
On the tech side, computer vision aims to put these theories and models into practice by building effective computer vision systems. 

 
According to the World Health Organization, there are about 39 million blind individuals worldwide,
highlighting the urgent need for assistive and rehabilitative devices.
One of the most common aids for the blind is the trusty white cane, often paired with a guide dog to help navigate around obstacles. 
Thanks to brain plasticity, blind individuals can use their occipital lobe to perceive objects through other senses, like hearing, 
which helps them identify moving obstacles. However, in unfamiliar environments, this can be quite challenging. 
Over the years, various commercial applications have emerged, with popular ones including GPS-powered tools like Mobile Geo, 
Braille Note GPS, and MoBIC, as well as computer vision-based applications like The VOICE, NAVI, ENVS, and TVS,
among others. The last few decades have seen remarkable advancements in computer hardware, leading to more affordable and 
compact high-performance computers which in turn empower scientists and developers in this exciting field.
